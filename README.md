### Cats Page Using Redux

Implement a Redux flow

- You must use at least one reducer but you can combine more than one if you like
- Include the dev tools extension
# Your reducer should be able to handle:
- Adding a new item to a collection in your store
- Updating an item in a collection in your store
- Deleting an item in a collection in your store
- At least one component in your app should have read access to the store:
- Retrieve all items in a collection in your store
- At least one component in your app should have write access to the store:
    - Add a new item
    - Update an item
    - Delete an item
- Add tests as appropriate

## Bonus

- Add redux-thunk
- Create an async action which calls an API
- Dispatch an action to your reducer which contains data that you've retrieved from the API
- Add the API data to your store and read it from a component in your React app
